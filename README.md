#phpstorm-theme-github-remixed

Get GitHub's syntax highlighting / colors and fonts within PHPStorm. In this theme I tried to be as close as possible
on the original colours, but switching the red comments (seriously GitHub, RED? :)) to a decent grey.
This is an experimental repo, not sure if this looks like it should look everywhere on every platform.
